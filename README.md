# Crash Course Beginner Competition

First, create a model that is able to predict what character appears given an image. Use the model-shell.py file as a guide.

Once you get a sufficiently accurate model, create a program that takes in an image of a document that is able to go through and find all the letters on the page.

Good luck!
